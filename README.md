# 🔍 Boogle - The Digital Slang Dictionary

Welcome to **Boogle** — not your average Google! This is a console-based slang dictionary app built using **C** with the mighty **Trie** data structure at its core. Designed for storing, searching, and exploring internet slang, Boogle helps keep up with the ever-evolving language of the internet.

## 📚 Background

This project was created as an individual assignment for the **Data Structures** course (COMP6048001) at **Bina Nusantara University** during the **Even Semester 2023/2024**.

The goal: to design and implement a computing solution using **Trie**, a prefix-based data structure, using the C programming language.

## 💡 Project Description

**Boogle** is a command-line dictionary app that lets users:

- **Add new slang words** along with their descriptions
- **Search for existing slang** to find out what they mean
- **Display all slang words** or just those that start with a specific prefix

All of this is handled efficiently thanks to the **Trie structure**, making prefix lookups lightning fast!
